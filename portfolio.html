    <h1>  We created a ice cream maker game, thast asks the user how many scoop they would like, as well as what 
    flavor they would like. We set a max of 11 scoops if you go over that number, our code will print 
   "Thats too many!" As for flavors, we have 11 set flavors. If you input a flavor that is not on the
    list, our code prints "Thats not on the menu."</h1>

<h1> Our forth project was "Rover Phone Home". Me and my partner guessed that the rover was in the Inland Forest. 
By modeling the environments, It helped identify the region the rover was located in. We found the rover by 
matching up the models with the descriptions given with our graphs and the data given. After comparing the 
diffrent data we decided on Inland Forest as the location of the rover.
