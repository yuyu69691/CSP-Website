    <h1>  We created a ice cream maker game, thast asks the user how many scoop they would like, as well as what 
	  flavor they would like. We set a max of 11 scoops if you go over that number, our code will print 
	  "Thats too many!" As for flavors, we have 11 set flavors. If you input a flavor that is not on the
	  list, our code prints "Thats not on the menu."</h1>
